#### The goal is to become well-prepared and successfully path the before mentioned certification exam till the end of March 2018.  
#### The repository birthdate is 21.11.2017.
#### Previously I've passed OCAJP exam with 97% score. It took a little more than a month to be prepared. Obviously OCPJP is much harder and requires much more time to prepare.
#### After taking an exam final score will be put over here ----> 000%.
